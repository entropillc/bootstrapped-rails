Feature: Bootstrapped Layout Generator
  In order to have a layout
  As a rails developer
  I want to generate a simple layout

  Scenario: Generate normal application layout
    Given a new Rails app
    When I run "rails g bootstrapped:layout -f"
    Then I should see "stylesheet_link_tag "application"" in file "app/views/layouts/application.html.erb"
    Then I should see "h(page_title" in file "app/helpers/layout_helper.rb"
    And I should see file "app/helpers/layout_helper.rb"
    And I should see file "app/helpers/error_messages_helper.rb"
    And I should see file "app/views/share/_flash.html.erb"
