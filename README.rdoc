= Bootstrapped Rails

A gem containing Twitter's Bootstrap CSS Project, a JQuery Plugin to simply user interface interactivity, and generators to make scaffolds sexy.

In addition, it as generators based off of Ryan Bates nifty-generators https://github.com/ryanb/nifty-generators/. enables you to create fully styled user interfaces using Bootstrap CSS with very little effort. There is one difference though, HAML generators are not included.

== Setup

=== Rails 3

Add the gem to your Gemfile.

  gem "bootstrapped-rails"

Add the following to the application.css in the Rails 3.1 pipeline pipeline

  //= require bootstrap
  //= require jquery.bootstrap
	
Add the following to the application.js in the Rails 3.1 asset pipeline

  //= require jquery.bootstrap
  //= require jquery.tablesorter
	
The Table Sorter JQuery plugin is only required if you want tables that allow you to order on the column headings.

Then you can run any of the included generators.

  rails g bootstrapped:scaffold Recipe name:string index new

== Included Generators

* bootstrapped:layout: generates generic layout, stylesheet, and helper files.
* bootstrapped:scaffold: generates a controller and optional model/migration.

To view the README for each generator, run it with the +help+ option.

  rails g bootstrapped:layout --help

== Troubleshooting and FAQs

<b>What is the difference between bootstrapped:scaffold and built-in scaffold?</b>

One of the primary differences is that bootstrapped:scaffold allows you to choose which controller actions to generate.

  rails g bootstrapped:scaffold post name:string index new edit

There are a few changes to the generated code as well, such as no XML format by default.

It also offers support for Shoulda, and RSpec.


<b>I get "undefined method 'title'" error.</b>

Try running bootstrapped:layout, that will generate this helper method. Or you can just change the templates to whatever approach you prefer for setting the title.


<b>I can't set new attributes in my model.</b>

Add the attribute to the attr_accessible line in the model.


<b>I get "undefined method 'root_url'" error.</b>

Some generators default redirecting to the root_url. Set this in your routes.rb file like this (substituting your controller name).

  root :to => "home#index"


<b>I get a missing database error.</b>

Run <tt>rake db:migrate</tt>.


<b>I get a routing error when I try to submit a form.</b>

Try restarting your development server. Sometimes it doesn't detect the change in the routing.


<b>The tests/specs don't work.</b>

Make sure you have mocha installed and require it in your spec/test helper.

  gem install mocha

  # in spec_helper.rb
  config.mock_with :mocha

  # in test_helper.rb
  require 'mocha'
